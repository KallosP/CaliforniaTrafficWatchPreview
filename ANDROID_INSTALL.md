# Android Installation

1. Join [this](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/testers-community) Google Group. 
2. Use the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kallosp.CaliforniaRoadViewer) or [Web](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.kallosp.CaliforniaRoadViewer) link to access the app.

That's it! It would be greatly appreciated if you kept CTW installed for 14+ days. See below.

## Why do I have to join a Google Group?
The process for publishing an app to the Google Play Store for individual developers has unfortunately been complicated recently. It's now required that 20 testers use the app for 14 consecutive days for eligibility to publish. In light of this, I've set closed testing for CTW to only be accessed by members of the Testers Community Google Group. This is a small community of indie developers that help each other meet the new eligiblity requirement from Google. For more info on the Testers Community, see [here](https://testerscommunity.com/). If you want a summary of the new Google policy see [this video](https://youtu.be/6uX0FdPAVFU). Thanks for your interest!
