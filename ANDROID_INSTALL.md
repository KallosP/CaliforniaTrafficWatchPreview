# Android Installation
1. Join [this](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/testers-community) Google Groups (required for the Google Play Store link to work). I've set closed testing for CTW to only be accessed by members of the Testers Community Google Group. This is a small community of indie developers that help each other meet the new eligiblity requirements from Google to publish an app to the Google Play Store. [More info](https://testerscommunity.com/). 
2. Use the [Android] or [Web] link to access the app.

It's now required that 20 testers use the app for 14 consecutive days for eligibility to publish. If you're interested in trying the app, please follow the steps outlined here.
